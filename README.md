## Overview
The purpose of Knack is to give users a way to track the various skills or techniques that are essential for performing a particular activity or discipline at a high level. It is essentially a tool for improvement. For example, up til now I have manually kept a written list of key swing thoughts that I use for my golf game. On a sheet of paper, I write down those thoughts or “tips” that I am either currently testing or have been proven over time. The ultimate fate for each new thought under test is to either discard it or mark it as proven and implement into my game permanently. Over time, I have used numerous sheets of paper as I have tested and discarded countless ideas to improve my game.

It would be more useful to convert this system into a digital format. Not only would it eliminate paper waste, but it would also provide a more portable and convenient way to manage this trial and error process. There are many additional features one could imagine, including saving “proven” tips, managing multiple “knacks” at once, or sharing tips with other users.
